Redesign of the neck Version 3
------------------------------

The new design of the neck intends to reduce all hardware devices. In that direction, the motors were replaced for new:

  * Maxon RE 16 âˆ…16 mm, Graphite Brushes, 4.5 Watt,

and the drivers have been replaced by:

  * iPOS3602 MX-CAN

The schematics are the same, but the new hardware needs much less space and can be embedded in the neck.

All the documentation is available in the [hardware](../hardware/README) section.
