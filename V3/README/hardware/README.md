Driver IPOS3604
--------------
The driver [iPOS3604](P028.002.E101.DSH.pdf) oversees the performing of the control task in the movement of the motors. The device is characterized by its completely digital intelligent servomechanism [^1] (servo), based in the latest DSP2 technology [^2] which offers high efficiency, combined with an integrated motion controller.

This kind of driver can perform a position, velocity or torque control in individual, multi-axis or independent configuration. The aforesaid movement controller allows the device to combine the controller, the driver and the PLC [^4] functionality in a single compact unit, being also capable of complex movements without the need of an external motion controller. The high level Technosoft's Motion Programming Language (TML) permits that the following operations could be executed directly in the driver level: Adjustment of various motion modes, changing those modes and their parameters, flux control of the program through interruptions and conditional calls, management of the input/output signals, performance of data transfer, etc.

All drivers are connected through a CAN 2.0B interface [^6] that can be configured with the hardware to operate in two different modes:

  * When CANOpen mode is selected, the driver is controlled with a CANOpen Master. This iPOS also offers the master the possibility of calling motion sequences written in TML and store in the EEPROM unit [^7], using the supplier specific objects.

  * When the TMLCAN [^8] mode is selected, the driver acts as an intelligent Technosoft standard unit and complies with the Technosoft protocol to exchange TML commands through the CANBUS.

When a higher-level coordination is needed, the units driver can be controlled with a CANOpen master but also with a PC or PLC using a TML_LIB motion library. 


Computer equipped with CANBus
-----------------------------
The computer is connected to the iPOS device through CANBus, using a communication interface between the aforesaid computer and drive, being consequently a CANBus based protocol. The fractional control is designed in this computer to communicate with the iPOS, so that the the control of the motor is performed through the device. 


Maxon Motor
------------
The Maxon Motor is the mechanical actuator in charge for the movement of neck's articulations. The motor receives the current from the driver device and transform them into mechanical action. The iPOS itself does the control action over the motor, as well as it provides it with power supply.


Power Source
------------
Provides power supply to the device driver, and consequently also to the motor.

The CANbus card incorporated in the computer is connected to the driver device through CAN. Moreover, the device is connected to the motor as a controller and power supplier.  Finally, this power is obtained from the power source that is used to feed the iPOS device.
This system is implemented inside the robot TEO, from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and it is employed in the articulationsâ€™ motion, which is controlled by the iPOS.
