DOCUMENTATION: CONTROL SYSTEM
-----------------------------
Considering that the [iPOS4808 MX](https://humasoft.github.io/documentation/README/hardware/) is used to build the system’s embedded control from the supplier Technosoft, the following documentation was used: 

[**TECHNOSOFT S.A., iPOS4808 MX – Technical Reference, Switzerland, 2014**](documentation/ref/technosoft/P091.027.iPOS4808.MX.UM.pdf)

The user manual where all the technical references are explained, as well as the hardware installation, the configuration of the device, it’s programmable modes, and other different parameters and functions which are needed for the correct functioning of the system.

[**TECHNOSOFT S.A., Motion Programming using Easy Motion Studio – User Manual, Switzerland, 2014**](documentation/ref/technosoft/P091.034.ESM.UM.pdf)

Easy Motion Studio is an integrated development environment which is used for the configuration and control of the motion of the motors through Technosoft intelligent devices.  The use of this software is fundamental for the programming of the iPOS4808 device.

[**TECHNOSOFT S.A., TML_LIB v2.0 – User Manual, Switzerland**](documentation/ref/technosoft/P091.040.v20.UM.pdf)

This manual explains the library TML_LIB which is composed by a series of functions that are used for the sign of the motors’ control system.


DOCUMENTATION: CANBUS / CANOPEN PROTOCOL
------------------------------------------
The communication between this iPOS decive is through CanOpen, which is a protocol that works with CanBus, being CanBus the environment of communication, and CanOpen the language in which computer and device communicate. In other words, the exact structure in which the data is sent. The following documentation contains the information for the aforesaid protocol:
